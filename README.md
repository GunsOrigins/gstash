# gstash.org

My personal website cloned from [Ryan Cao's](https://github.com/ryanccn/ryanccn.dev) with some modifications, made with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

## Project

- `src/_layouts/`: layouts
- `src/_data/`: global data stuff fed to Eleventy
- `src/utils/`: node scripts & utilities related to the build process
- `src/posts/*.md`: the blog posts, written in Markdown
- `images/`: images for the blog posts

## Get started

```bash
$ yarn        # install deps
$ yarn dev    # start development server
$ yarn build  # run production build
$ yarn clean  # clean up build artifacts and caches
```
